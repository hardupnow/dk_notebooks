    "## What is MetPy?\n",
    "MetPy is a modern meteorological toolkit for Python. It is now a maintained project of [Unidata](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu) to serve the academic meteorological community. MetPy consists of three major areas of functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](MetPy_breakdown.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plots\n",
    "As meteorologists, we have many field specific plots that we make. Some of these, such as the Skew-T Log-p require non-standard axes and are difficult to plot in most plotting software. In MetPy we've baked in a lot of this specialized functionality to help you get your plots made and get back to doing science. We will go over making different kinds of plots during the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculations\n",
    "Meteorology also has a common set of calculations that everyone ends up programming themselves. This is error-prone and a huge duplication of work! MetPy contains a set of well tested calculations that is continually growing in an effort to be at feature parity with other legacy packages such as GEMPAK.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File I/O\n",
    "Finally, there are a number of odd file formats in the meteorological community. MetPy has incorporated a set of readers to help you deal with file formats that you may encounter during your research."

    "Early in our scientific careers we all learn about the importance of paying attention to units in our calculations. Unit conversions can still get the best of us and have caused more than one major technical disaster, including the crash and complete loss of the $327 million [Mars Climate Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter).\n",
    "\n",
    "In MetPy, we use the [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library and a custom unit registry to help prevent unit mistakes in calculations. That means that every quantity you pass to MetPy should have units attached, just like if you were doing the calculation on paper! Attaching units is easy:"

That means that not only is there a scaling factor, but also an offset. This makes the math and unit book-keeping a little more complex. Imagine adding 10 degrees Celsius to 100 degrees Celsius. Is the answer 110 degrees Celsius or 383.15 degrees Celsius (283.15 K + 373.15 K)? That's why there are delta degrees units in the unit registry for offset units. For more examples and explanation you can watch [MetPy Monday #13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iveJCqxe3Z4).\n",
